# CSJ Subtitle Generator Plugin

This is a plugin based on ESPnet toolkit CSJ ASR recipe, aiming at generating subtitle from Japanese-speech Audio file AUTOMATICALLY. As CSJ corpus is essentially created by academic speech recording so we highly recommend using this tool on academic-domain japanese ASR.

This Plugin contains 3 parts of function:

## Voice activity detection
## ESPnet-like preparation
## Srt-format Subtitle generation
