CSJ Subtitle Generator Plugin

This is as plugin based on ESPnet toolkit CSJ ASR recipe, aiming at generating subtitle from Japanese-speech Audio file. As CSJ corpus is essentially created by academic speech recording so we highly recommend using this tool on academic-domain japanese ASR.

This Plugin contains 3 function parts:

# Voice activity detection
# ESPnet-like preparation
# srt-formant Subtitle generation
