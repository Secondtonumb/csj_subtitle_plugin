# CSJ Subtitle Generator Plugin

This is a plugin based on [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) toolkit [CSJ ASR](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/tree/c05d5cf32c215943f069dd0a9f40cf3aa66d3bed/egs/csj/asr1) recipe, aiming at generating subtitle from Japanese-speech Audio file AUTOMATICALLY. As CSJ corpus is essentially created by academic speech recordings so we highly recommend using this plugin on academic-domain japanese ASR.

This Plugin contains 3 parts of function:

## Voice activity detection
## ESPnet-like preparation
## Srt-format Subtitle generation
